A few examples on how to set up simpleIC in XML.
The first is the "bare minimum" XML code needed to get simpleIC working.
I have not included the <animations> </animations> lines used to animate the windows/doors etc. since that is universal as it uses basegame animations.
If you don't know how to do that, look at a tutorial which explains that or ask someone (after you tried to figure out yourself of course).
The second example is the current "normal" code with all the optional stuff.
The third example is using triggerPoint_ON and triggerPoint_OFF which means that instead of one "X" to click as a toggle you've got two marks, one that will
"open" the animation, the other one that will close the "animation".
The triggerPoint stuff is global to the script so if I add features in future that aren't controlling animations, it is still "valid" to use off and on points.

For an example on how it is actually implemented in a mod, take a look at my Deutz Agrostar Edit I linked in the Readme on Github. (youtube video link)


## absolute basic IC function animation lines:
______________________________________________
-- animationName -> name of the animation controlled by this IC function
-- insideTrigger triggerPoint -> index of the transform group that marks the trigger point 
<simpleIC >
	<animation animationName="windowFront"  >
		<insideTrigger triggerPoint="sic_frontWindow_innerNode" />
	</animation>				
</simpleIC>


## advanced IC function animation lines with optional stuff:
____________________________________________________________
-- outsideInteractionTrigger -> index of the playerTrigger for outside (onFoot) interaction 
-- animationName -> name of the animation controlled by this IC function 
-- animationSpeed -> speed the animation is played at (can also be negative) 
-- sharedAnimation -> not yet implemented 
-- soundVolumeIncreasePercentage -> percentage by which the volume will increase from insideVolume to outsideVolume if this animation is "on" e.g. door/window is open 
-- insideTrigger -> line for the triggerPoints that can be triggered from inside camera 
-- outsideTrigger -> line for the triggerPoints that can be triggered from outside camera or player on foot 
-- triggerPoint -> index of the transform group that marks the particular trigger point 
-- triggerPointSize -> radius around the triggerPoint in cm where it still registeres as triggered 
-- reachDistance -> the max. distance to which a player can reach an IC point (indoor camera only, default 1.8)
<simpleIC outsideInteractionTrigger="sic_playerTrigger" reachDistance="1.8" >
	<animation animationName="windowFront" animationSpeed="1" sharedAnimation="false" soundVolumeIncreasePercentage="0.5" >
		<insideTrigger triggerPoint="sic_frontWindow_innerNode" triggerPointSize="0.04" />
		<outsideTrigger triggerPoint="sic_frontWindow_outerNode" triggerPointSize="0.04" />
	</animation>	
</simpleIC>

## advanced IC function animation lines with optional 2 trigger points (on and off point instead of toggle):
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
-- all the same as the one above except:
-- triggerPoint_ON -> index of the transform group that marks the particular triggerPoint for turning the IC function "on" (animation playing towards end)
-- triggerPoint_OFF -> index of the transform group that marks the particular triggerPoint for turning the IC function "off" (animation playing towards start)
<simpleIC outsideInteractionTrigger="sic_playerTrigger" >
	<animation animationName="windowFront" animationSpeed="1" sharedAnimation="false" soundVolumeIncreasePercentage="0.5" >
			<insideTrigger triggerPoint_ON="sic_windowFront_innerNode_ON" triggerPoint_OFF="sic_windowFront_innerNode_OFF" triggerPointSize="0.04" />
			<outsideTrigger triggerPoint_ON="sic_windowFront_outerNode_ON" triggerPoint_OFF="sic_windowFront_outerNode_OFF" triggerPointSize="0.04" />
	</animation>	
</simpleIC>


## IC function with easy cylinder animation:
____________________________________________
-- as for the cylinderAnimations:
-- node1 -> index of one of the nodes for the cylinder 
-- node2 -> index of the other node for the cylinder 
----------------------------------------------------
cylinder-nodes are directed at each other, meaning the other part is also acting as reference point.
In order for this to work, the cylinder-parts pivot has to be oriented in a way that the positive Z axis points the direction the cylinder-part points at.
The "rotation" axis is the Y axis (green axis)

<simpleIC outsideInteractionTrigger="sic_playerTrigger" >
	<animation animationName="doorRight" animationSpeed="1" sharedAnimation="false" soundVolumeIncreasePercentage="0.5" >
		<insideTrigger triggerPoint="sic_doorRight_innerNode" triggerPointSize="0.04" />
		<outsideTrigger triggerPoint="sic_doorRight_outerNode" triggerPointSize="0.04" />
	</animation>	

	<cylinderAnimations>
		<cylinder node1="doorLeft_strutCyl_left" node2="doorLeft_strutMain_left" />
	</cylinderAnimations>
</simpleIC>

## IC function attacherControl:
-- attacherIndex -> Index of Attacher in XML (same as for powerTakeoffConfigurations, hoses etc.) 
-- (optional) leverAnimation -> animation to be played for a lever/button, animation is synchronized to lowered/raised state of attacher 
			-- animationName -> name of animation for leverAnimation
			-- (optional) doNotSynch -> don't synch lever animation to inputs with key-binding instead of simpleIC. Not sure why you'd want that but its there if you need it 
			-- (optional) returnToCenter -> lever will return to center of its animation when implement is finished raising or lowering 
			-- (optional) returnToCenterRaised -> lever will return to center of its animation when implement is raised only
			-- (optional) returnToCenterLowered -> lever will return to center of its animation when implement is lowered only 
			! of course only one, either returnToCenter or returnToCenterLowered or returnToCenterRaised should be true anything else doesn't make sense and might not return the expected result !
-- triggerPoints work exactly the same as for animations (see above), so you can do triggerPoint_ON and triggerPoint_OFF for raising/lowering too 
<simpleIC outsideInteractionTrigger="sic_playerTrigger" >
	<attacherControl attacherIndex="3" >
		<leverAnimation animationName="leverAnimationPTO" doNotSynch="false" returnToCenter="true" returnToCenterRaised="true" returnToCenterLowered="true" />
		<insideTrigger triggerPoint="sic_attacherBack_insideTrigger" triggerPointSize="0.04" />
		<outsideTrigger triggerPoint="sic_attacherBack_outsideTrigger" triggerPointSize="0.04" />
	</attacherControl>
</simpleIC>


## IC function ptoControl:
-- attacherIndex -> Index of Attacher in XML in which the implement needs to be attached for this pto control to control it
(Everything is the same as with attacherControl)
-- (optional) leverAnimation, doNotSynch (optional) set to true if you don't want to synch animation with turning implement on/off with key-binding instead of IC 
<simpleIC outsideInteractionTrigger="sic_playerTrigger" >
	<ptoControl attacherIndex="1" >
		<leverAnimation animationName="leverAnimationPTO" doNotSynch="false" />
		<insideTrigger triggerPoint="sic_pto_back" triggerPointSize="0.04" />		
	</ptoControl>
</simpleIC>
